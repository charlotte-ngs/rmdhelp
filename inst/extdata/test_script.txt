#'
#' ## Purpose
#' This script prepares the folder structure before a new gs analysis is run.
#'
#' ## Settings
#' The following three statements determine the behavior of the complete script.
#+ script-setting, eval=FALSE
set -o errexit    # exit immediately, if single command exits with non-zero status
set -o nounset    # treat unset variables as errors
set -o pipefail   # return value of pipeline is value of last command to exit with non-zero status
                  # hence pipe fails if one command in pipe fails

#' ## Constants
#' Constant variables about the directory where the script is located, about the name of
#' the script and about the hostname of the server on which the script runs are set.
#+ constants-assigned, eval=FALSE
SCRIPT_DIR=$(cd \"$(dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")\" && pwd)
SCRIPT=$(basename ${BASH_SOURCE[0]})
SERVER=`hostname`
